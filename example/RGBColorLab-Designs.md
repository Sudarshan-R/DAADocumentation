RGB Color Lab - Designs
================

Description and fabrication process
--------
The box designed for teaching children how computers “see” colors using a playful experiment. The object shape adopted from the computer world to connote the direct connection to the digital world. The design aimed to be simple, and to create intuitive and easy interface to operate. There are two main parts, the action area and display area. The two parts defined by different levels. The display part is placed in an angle so the children can see easily the outcome of their actions. The action part divided to two by a line and a switch. The first part, that close to the children is the RGB reader, where the children can place colorful boards and see in the display area the amount of red green and blue of the chosen color, the brightness of each channel and the mixed color.
The second option to action, which placed above the RGB reader, is to change the color using the sliders with the red green and blue knobs. All the different elements constantly aligned by the red green and blue position for visual connection. The box made out of 21 pieces (including the knobs) all cut through the laser cut machine.

The color board cut in the laser cut, and color paper pated to it.
