Abstract
--------
The RGB color lab is a project to demonstrate at children how computer “see” colors. In other words, the child can understand how the RGB system works by testing different physical colors and see the amount of red green and blue in it, also the digital mixed color is being displayed for demonstrating the full process of calculating colors and the shift from physical color to digital color. The child is also able to change the values using sliders, and influence directly on the digital color. The project attempts to explain in a simple fun and playful way and without numbers how the RGB color system works in the computer.

Interface, interaction modalities and user experience
--------
The RGB color lab project is a physical computing project based on Arduino platform, which includes the software development, electronics and physical design of the object. The object (basically a long wood box) is divided into two main parts; the playing area - where the children can test colors, and the display part - where they see the outcome of the changes they made. There is a linear process that the interface attempt to simulate in the display's components order. First the children need to choose the way they want to test the color, physically (with a physical color board) or digitally (with sliders). Then, on the output display, they can see the evolution of the color. First the amount of the red green and blue channels is displayed by using for each one a LEDs level bar. On top of it, are placed a separated red, green and blue LED that display the brightness of the related channel color. At the top of the box there is the digital mixed color, using RGB LEDs.
The object shape give the user in first impression the feeling of a machine that has to process and calculate data without mention or show numbers. In that way the operation of the object is simple, intuitive, playful and yet demonstrate a calculation process of how the computer produce the end color that we see on the display.
