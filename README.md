--------

This is the repository of the projects developed by students of Master of Advanced Studies in Interaction Design during the CAS2 Designing Advanced Artifacts.[CAS2 Designing Advanced Artifacts](http://www.maind.supsi.ch/program-overview/structure-2/module-2/ "Title")

The projects are documented according the master program - project documentation guidelines.[See documentation guidelines.](http://www.maind.supsi.ch/program-overview/structure-2/module-2/ "Title").

Materials
--------

Project documentation materials are the following:  
1. Standard project description;  
2. Source files (code + design + hardware);  
3. High resolution video (1024 x 768 or higher);  
4. Pictures in high and low resolution (web);  
5. Presentation slides and sketches;  

The project description and the sources files are published on **Github**   
Video, photo and slides are uploaded to the **SUPSI server**     
(path: DACD >  Didattica > MAIND-1314 > Assignments)   

Structure
--------
The documentation structure consists in four submission forms:   
 
**1.	Project** 
What is your interactive project about? What is it for? What functions and metaphors it involves? Can you refer to something similar?  

**2.	Designs**   
How is the design of your project? What objects, structure, parts is made of? What techniques and machines you used to create it?  

**3.	Code**  
What software or language your application is based on? How it works? Which libraries or codes from other projects it includes?  

**4.	Hardware and electronics** 
What hardware your project uses? What sensors and actutators if features? What electronic components it uses and other project schematics?
