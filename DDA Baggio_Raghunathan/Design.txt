DESIGN TITLE:  Internet connected “Treasure hunting” board game with hexagonal blocks/segments and themed tiles/player characters
 
DESCRIPTION AND FABRICATION PROCESS:
We have fourteen hexagonal shaped segments that forms the base of our player’s game boundaries. They have crevices in the centre to provide space to place the light sensor within them.
 
We have used the laser cutting machine’s light cut in order to achieve the correct dimension, shape and detail that our object requires. Furthermore, after vigorous sanding, a layer of lacquer has been added atop both the boards and general surfaces.

Further to this plaster had been added to the model to give it a smoother sheen/feel for its surface and finally we add a layer of paint to give it the required color.

The light cut feature has been used to achieve the lines and geometry that denote the hexagonal cells, all fourteen of which have been done using the same process.
Similarly, the hexagonal tiles denoting the treasures and also the player characters have been cut using the same dimensions as those on the board, making for a total of 10 tiles (2 player character tiles, 8 treasures).

Finally we have cut eight equal crevices within each board to fit the score board and its LED’s. Then we have a main hole which fits within itself, the RGB LED used to denote user interaction.

The undersides of all the parts have been glued to one another and this gives some structural rigidity to the model.    
 
Translucent paper is added atop the LED’s to cover them and for aesthetic reasons.
Considering that the shape of the board symbolises a Honeycomb, we have stuck to the concept of a player character being a bear and chasing honeycombs, which happens to be the hidden treasure.

With this we get a fairly decent description of our model.
